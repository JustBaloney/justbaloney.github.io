            <div><p>Hi, I'm Saloni, Design Lead at Spotify, London where I’ve co-created product strategy, driven product vision, produced experience frameworks, and managed and coached a team of four early-career to senior designers. I enjoy leading through ambiguity & gnarly problem spaces using insights and deep collaboration. I have worked for over 8 years as a product design IC across a variety of domains & companies from pre-seed startups to fortune 500, collaborating with teams of different sizes & constellations.</p>
