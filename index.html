            <div><p>Hi, I'm Saloni, Design Lead and Manager at Spotify, London where I’ve co-created product strategy, driven product vision, produced experience frameworks, and managed and coached a team of four early-career to senior designers. I enjoy leading through ambiguity & gnarly problem spaces using insights and deep collaboration. Previous to this, I have worked for over 8 years as a product design IC across a variety of domains & companies from pre-seed startups to fortune 500, collaborating with teams of different sizes & constellations.</p>

          <p class="bold subdued">Spotify · 2023-24</p>
          <p> As the design lead for the Activation product area with the mission to "help people fall in love with Spotify", I'm committed to improving in-product journeys to help users unlock value in features, formats & tiers. I drive key business KPIs and opportunities for learning & experimentation across tiers– directly managing & coaching a team of four early-career to senior designers, and overseeing a product area of 5 squads.</p>

          <p class="bold subdued">Spotify · 2023 </p>
          <p>As part of a major change to the Free user experience in select markets, I helped reduce conversion losses by improving awareness of Premium for new and free users so as to better inform mental models of the tiers. We tested and shipped nudges to Premium from a broader vision for how we might build conversion journeys across Spotify.</p>

          <p> I led design for the 0-1 of the designer-developer collaboration workflows in Adobe XD, collaborating with several other designers. Even in an MVP scope, the solution successfully migrated users' preferred handoff mode from 3rd party apps to within the Adobe eco-system and eased continuous collaboration.</p>
