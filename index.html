            <div><p>Hi, I'm Saloni. Currently a design lead and manager at Spotify, London where I manage an international team of four junior to senior designers, while also staying hands-on with strategy and experience. Previously, I have worked as an IC across a variety of companies from pre-seed to fortune 500, collaborating with teams of different sizes.</p>
            <p>I love leading through gnarly problems & ambiguity by utilising insights & deep collaboration. Forward thinking and outcome focused, I have demonstrated impact in driving product strategy vision-first. In terms of domains, I bring expertise in behavioral design, growth and building data-rich products using machine learning and generative models.</p>

          <p class="bold subdued">Spotify</p>
          <p> I was asked to step into the role of design lead for the Activation product area where we articulated our mission to be "to help people fall in love with Spotify". Here, I help drive key business KPIs and opportunities for learning & experimentation across tiersâ€“ directly managing & coaching a team of four early-career to senior designers, and overseeing a product area of 5 squads.</p>

          <p class="bold subdued">Spotify</p>
          <p>As part of a major change to the Free user experience in select markets, I helped reduce conversion losses by improving awareness of Premium for new and free users so as to better inform mental models of the tiers. We tested and shipped nudges to Premium from a broader vision for how we might build conversion journeys across Spotify.</p>
